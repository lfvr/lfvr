### Hi! I'm Lauren ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught developer focused on web development with Python and JavaScript. I love learning new skills, and building new projects from scratch. I also enjoy going back and tweaking my code once it's functional to improve performance and making sure it adheres to DRY and SRP principles. 

- âš¡ Favourite languages/frameworks: Python, Django, React
- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: Node.js
- ðŸ‘¯ Looking to collaborate on: a new open source project - get in touch!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: travel tech and APIs
- ðŸ“« Send me a message!

Projects on my GitHub are functional only - for examples of design work please drop me a message!
