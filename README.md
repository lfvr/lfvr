### Hi! I'm Lauren 👋

I'm a self-taught developer focused on web development with Python and JavaScript. I love learning new skills, and building new projects from scratch. I also enjoy going back and tweaking my code once it's functional to improve performance and making sure it adheres to DRY and SRP principles. 

- ⚡ Favourite languages/frameworks: Python, Django, React
- 🛠️ Favourite tools: VSCode, GitHub (obviously!)
- 🌱 Currently learning: Node.js
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on: a new open source project - get in touch!
- 💬 Ask me about: travel, APIs, anything interesting 😊
- 📫 [Send me a message](mailto:lfvr.github@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Hi!)

Projects on my GitHub are functional only - for examples of design work feel free to drop me a message!
